# Vid2Photogrammetry
Software to process videos into an image sequence optimised for use with photogrammetry software. 
A-level computer science project

## Features:
* Extract n frames from any input video into an output folder
* Logical naming of output frames
* Resizing extracted frames
* Deleting unacceptably blurry extracted frames
* Resizing of extracted frames
* Denoising of extracted frames
* Removal of "outlier" extracted frames (frames where something is covering the camera, for example)
* Removal of duplicate (or very near duplicate) extracted frames
* Easy to use GUI

## Compiling:
This section needs to be re-done since I moved away from using python to manage the Qt GUI
